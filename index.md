subtitle: A response to the inner life of people during these unprecedented and uncertain times. We are a gathering of artists and filmmakers who will make a series of short films to explore our current situation on our terms.

This is not news gathering or reporting. It is storytelling, it is poetry, it is prose, with humans (as opposed to the economy) at the heart of our process. We believe that what makes us strong are the things that make us interesting to one another: our capacity for love in spite of our circumstances, our capacity for empathy, a sense of what is decent and fair, and our ability to act upon these things. Thereâ€™s also the darkness that falls across us in times like this. We need to look that squarely in the eye without flinching, and engage with that.
